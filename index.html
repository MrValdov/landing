                'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you<br>
                But you should know I might be cynical towards you<br>
                But I just can't believe that I'm for you<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you<br>
                Just let me know (yeah)<br>
                And I know that we just met<br>
                But could you take me everywhere you've ever been?<br>
                I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah<br>
                You are formidable to me<br>
                'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you<br>
                But you should know I might bе clinical, don't you tell<br>
                I won't break your heart if you can brеak my spell<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you<br>
                Just let me know<br>
                Fast-forward 13 years now<br>
                Don't know what it was, but somehow we played it out in reverse<br>
                I'm afraid of you now, more than I was at first<br>
                And I know you just left, but can I take you everywhere we've ever been?<br>
                I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah<br>
                You are formidable to me<br>
                'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you<br>
                But you should know I might be cynical towards you<br>
                I'm just worried my loyalty will bore you<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you<br>
                Just let me know<br>
                Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you<br>
