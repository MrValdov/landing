                The innocent can never last
                Wake me up when September ends
                Like my father's come to pass
                Seven years has gone so fast
                Wake me up when September ends
                Here comes the rain again
                Falling from the stars
                Drenched in my pain again
                Becoming who we are
                As my memory rests
                But never forgets what I lost
                Wake me up when September ends
                Summer has come and passed
                The innocent can never last
                Wake me up when September ends
                Ring out the bells again
                Like we did when spring began
                Wake me up when September ends
                Here comes the rain again
                Falling from the stars
                Drenched in my pain again
                Becoming who we are
                As my memory rests
                But never forgets what I lost
                Wake me up when September ends
                Summer has come and passed
                The innocent can never last
                Wake me up when September ends
                Like my father's come to pass
                20 years has gone so fast
                Wake me up when September ends
                Wake me up when September ends
                Wake me up when September ends...</p></div>
