            <div class="item-b"><p>… How do I say goodbye to what we had?<br>
                The good times that made us laugh<br>
                Outweigh the bad<br>
                … I thought we'd get to see forever<br>
                But forever's gone away<br>
                It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday<br>
                … I don't know where this road<br>
                Is going to lead<br>
                All I know is where we've been<br>
                And what we've been through<br>
                … And if we get to see tomorrow<br>
                I hope it's worth all the wait<br>
                It's hard to say goodbye to yesterday<br>
                … And I'll take with me the memories<br>
                To be my sunshine after the rain<br>
                It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday<br>
                … And I'll take with me the memories<br>
                To be my sunshine after the rain<br>
                It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.</p></div>
