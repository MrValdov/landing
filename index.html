                The innocent can never last<br>
                Wake me up when September ends<br>
                Like my father's come to pass<br>
                Seven years has gone so fast<br>
                Wake me up when September ends<br>
                Here comes the rain again<br>
                Falling from the stars<br>

                Ring out the bells again<br>
                Like we did when spring began<br>
                Wake me up when September ends<br>
                Here comes the rain again<br>
                Falling from the stars<br>

                Summer has come and passed<br>
                The innocent can never last<br>
                Wake me up when September ends<br>
                Like my father's come to pass<br>
                20 years has gone so fast<br>
                Wake me up when September ends<br>
                Wake me up when September ends<br>
                Wake me up when September ends...</p></div>
